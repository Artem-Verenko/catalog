# AIA Podcast's AI Tools Catalog
This is a catalog of tools that have been mentioned in the [AIA Podcast](https://itbeard.com/aia). 
These tools are AI-powered and can be useful in programming, content creation, and increasing your effectiveness

### How do I add my service to the catalog?
Visit our chat on [Telegram](https://t.me/aiapodcast) (RU lang) and send us the link to your service with a short description. If your service is helpful and interesting enough, we will discuss it in the next episode of the AIA Podcast and then add it to our catalog. This is the only way to get into this catalog.

### How can I add improvements to the catalog?
Make a fork of this repository, then make improvements and send a PR (Pull Request) to our repository. Alternatively, you can create an Issue with a description of the improvements, and we will implement them if we decide that they are acceptable and meaningful.
